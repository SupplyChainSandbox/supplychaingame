## Objective

Protecting your organization’s information in a digitally-connected world means understanding not only your organization’s immediate supply chain, but also the security of the extended ecosystem and all entities involved. The SupplyChainSandbox Jeopardy group is educating the public about supply chain risk management through an interactive fun and educational experience.

## Background

### Supply Chain Jeopardy Game 
With a range of categories, team up with other players to test your supply chain and risk management knowledge in a fun, interactive game of jeopardy.
The jeopardy will be in a PPT format complete with music and (hopefully) a countdown timer


## WHO WE’LL NEED
*Game Organizer:* This person will prepare the Kaltura meeting and manage the game behind the scenes to include sharing their screen, splitting the attendees into teams, clicking the questions/answers that was selected, muting/opening microphones, tallying the points, and answering questions in the chat box. 
*Game Host:* This person will manage the game on the front-end to include narrating the game, reading the questions, asking Team Leaders for the final answer, and reading the scores. 
*Team Lead/Captain:* The is the individual in each team selected to state the final answer out loud. 

## HOST INSTRUCTIONS
Explain to attendees that they will be split into 2-3 teams using the Kaltura’s The purpose of the breakout is to visibly see/know who is on their team, to choose a team name, and to appoint one person as the Team Leader who will provide the final answer. Allow 3 minutes for this. 

After, they will be brought back into the main room where the actual game action will take place. It’ll be fun to hear the answering team as they select the question and discuss the answer.

Each team member will have the opportunity to select a category (Game Show Host can read the participant name in order from the breakout rooms). If the participant doesn’t answer, ask the Team Leader to select the category. 

As the Host, ask Team 1 to open their microphones and everyone else to mute theirs. Next, ask the first member in Team 1 to choose a category and a prize amount. For example, “Zee, Supply Chain Threats for 200”. Remind Team 1, they have 30 seconds to provide an answer and that the Team Leader should say it aloud or type it in.
Question…If they give the wrong answer, should the first person from the other teams to say the answer in the main room gain the points? 
- The Game Organizer will do all the PPT clicking since they are sharing their screen. S/he will also verify that the right microphones are ON and to MUTE the others. 

The round ends when the answer is given. The Game Organizer returns to the main Category board and the Game Host calls the first person from Team 2 to select a Category.


## SCORING RULES
1. Teams will take turns selecting a question from the Category board as well as providing the answer. 
  1. Round is over if the Team Lead provides the correct answer. 
  1. If incorrect, the first person to type the correct answer from the other teams can take the points.
  1. Teams failing to provide an answer when the time is up will not score and the first person to type the correct answer from the other teams can take the points.

## KALTURA PLATFORM QUESTIONS:
- How are screens shared via Kaltura platform?
- How do we ensure other players are able to hear the PPT game noises? Is there a ‘Share computer sound’ option (like in Zoom)?
- Does Kaltura have a Breakout room feature?
- Does Kaltura have the ability to automatically split attendees into a certain amount of groups?
- Will one of us (on the CISA team) be able to run the slides (via the shared screen) + mute microphones while someone else acts as the Game Host?


## Vision

Supply chain management is a critical factor of business success. As software increasingly drives business value, organizations can achieve greater efficiency, agility, and effectiveness - as well as security - by applying similar principles to their cyber supply chains. Vulnerabilities in components such as processors, network stacks, and platform dependencies have shown that supply chain visibility is shallow, while risk runs deep.

In a just-in-time-delivery world, cybersecurity disruptions to traditional logistics and planning. Not Petya halted operations for shipping companies worldwide, providing a vivid illustration of how dependent organizations have become on their partners’ cybersecurity for physical, as well as digital, assets.


## Communications

Anyone is welcome to join our open discussions of Supply Chain Sandbox Jeopardy Game and share ideas on how to improve the concept. Much of the work of the group happens outside of SupplychainSandbox meetings and we encourage project teams to share progress updates or post questions in these channels:
